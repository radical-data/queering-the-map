	<p>Queering the Map is a community generated counter-mapping platform for digitally archiving LGBTQ2IA+ experience in relation to physical space.</p>
	
	<p>The platform provides an interface to collaboratively record the cartography of queer life—from park benches to the middle of the ocean—in order to preserve our histories and unfolding realities, which continue to be invalidated, contested, and erased. From collective action to stories of coming out, encounters with violence to moments of rapturous love, Queering the Map functions as a living archive of queer life.</p>
	
	<p>Through mapping LGBTQ2IA+ experience in its intersectional permutations, the project works to generate affinities across difference and beyond borders—revealing the ways in which we are intimately connected.</p>

	<p>Queering the Map was initiated on the unceded traditional lands of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation. The island currently called “Montreal” is known as Tiohtia:ke in the language of the Kanien’kehá:ka, and it has historically been a meeting place for other Indigenous nations.</p>
	
	<p>A queer approach to space points out the limitations of the ways in which the world around us is produced and normalized by and for certain bodies and not others. It is pertinent that we continuously reflect and act on the ways in which LGBTQIA+ life is complicit in ongoing processes of settler-colonialism. How does race, gender, sexuality, citizenship, ability, and class affect the ways in which we relate to, move through, and create space? As a pin on Queering the Map in Honolulu, Hawaii attests: “queer liberation must mean decolonization, and decolonization must mean queer liberation.”</p>
	
	<p>If you are not currently aware of the rightful keepers of the land on which you are located, you can learn more at <a href="https://native-land.ca/" target="_blank">www.native-land.ca</a>. Beyond simply acknowledging the colonial histories of the land on which you are located, we encourage you to take concrete steps towards decolonization by learning more about the ways in which you can support Indigenous communities in the fight for sovereignty.</p>
